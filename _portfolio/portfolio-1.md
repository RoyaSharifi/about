title: "Renpy Project"
excerpt: "This project is a short interactive story created with Ren'Py. It follows a girl and a boy who meet by accident on a university campus. As they get to know each other, their relationship grows, and the story ends with their marriage. The narrative explores moments of connection, friendship, and love in everyday life. 
I chose Ren'Py because it’s a great tool for building visual novels and interactive stories. It allowed me to combine dialogue, images, music, and choices in a simple way, making the story feel more engaging and emotional. Adding background music helped set the mood for each scene and made the experience more immersive. Ren'Py helped me bring my characters to life and guide the reader through their journey.
