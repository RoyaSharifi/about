title: "Twine Project"
excerpt: "This project is an interactive journey through the four regions of Iran: North, South, West, and East. Each section shares a glimpse of the culture, nature, and beauty found in that part of the country.

I used Twine because it's a great tool for telling interactive stories. It lets the reader choose where to go next, just like exploring a map. I wanted to make the experience feel personal and engagingâ€”like a small digital adventure through Iran.
