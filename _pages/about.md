Hi there! My name is Roya Sharifi. I graduated from the University of Alberta with a Master’s in Digital Humanities. My work focuses on how AI-driven tools impact ethics and bias in assessing immigrant documents. I’m currently working as a Research Assistant, exploring the use of software tools in immigration case processing in Canada. Through this project, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of how automation, surveillance, and decision-making operate within bureaucratic systems. I’m also involved with the Bridging Divides initiative, led by my supervisor, which examines the relationship between digital technologies and social inequality.

A Manifesto on Writing, Making, and Gaming:
======
Writing, making, and gaming are not separate practices — they are ways of thinking, feeling, and challenging the world. For me, writing is more than recording ideas; it is a political and creative act that helps shape new realities. Whether I am analyzing immigration systems or building interactive narratives, I use writing to question the values embedded in our technologies and to amplify perspectives that are often overlooked. Making — whether through Twine, Ren’Py, or code — allows me to turn critique into tangible experiences, where readers and users can engage directly with complex topics like bias, surveillance, and power.


Gaming, especially in the context of interactive storytelling, is a powerful way to foster empathy, agency, and reflection. I see games not just as entertainment, but as platforms to experiment with ethical questions and systemic critique. Through choice-based narratives and visual storytelling, I can invite others into speculative spaces that imagine different futures — ones where decision-making systems are fairer and more transparent. In my practice, writing, making, and gaming come together as creative research: a space to both analyze and reimagine the digital systems that shape our lives.

Research Interests:
======
My research interests lie at the intersection of technology, ethics, and migration. Specifically, I focus on:
* Algorithmic decision-making in immigration – analyzing how AI-driven tools are used in the assessment of immigrant documents and their impact on fairness, bias, and transparency.
*  Automation in bureaucratic systems – exploring the social and ethical implications of surveillance, digital processing, and administrative decision-making.
* Critical digital humanities – drawing from interdisciplinary approaches to study the relationship between technology and social inequality.
* Interactive storytelling as public scholarship – using tools like Twine and Ren’Py to:
    * Visualize data and processes
    * Challenge dominant narratives
    * Make complex systems more accessible and engaging for broader audiences
